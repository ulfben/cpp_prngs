/*This file demonstrates a few ideas for sourcing entropy in C++. 
    std::random_device is typically hardware-based, high-quality entropy and works fine on most platforms and configurations. 
    However, there are times when you might need other sources of entropy â€” perhaps for speed reasons, to generate seeds at 
compile time, or when targeting portable devices without hardware / kernel entropy evailable. 

Use these functions as inspiration and adjust for your own platform and needs.*/

// createSeeds uses time-since-the-epoch, CPU time, thread ID, and a stack memory address as sources of entropy.
// each value is hashed and then further mixed using splitmix64. 
// hashing *and* splitmixing is very likely overkill. One or the other ought to be fine.
